# The "organism" field is needed for GO term analysis. Leave it empty

# dmelanogaster, celegans)
organism: 'mmusculus'

mapping:
  mapper: 'hisat2' # options are star or hisat2

coverage:
  tool: 'megadepth' # options are megadepth or bamCoverage

# Configuration for how to do read counting using
# GenomicAlignments::summarizeOverlaps feature type and grouping
# features must match what is available in the GTF file most GTF files
# will use "exon" or "CDS" as features and "gene_id", and
# "transcript_id" for combining features.
counting:
  counting_mode: "Union" # other options are "IntersectionStrict" and "IntersectionNotEmpty"
  drop_nonunique: TRUE # boolean, When set to TRUE, multi-mapping reads are not counted (see inter.feature argument of summarizeOverlaps)
  strandedness: "reverse" # other options are "forward" and "reverse" for strand-specific read-counting
  feature: "exon"
  group_feature_by: "gene_id"
  yield_size: 2000000 # how many reads to process at a time (this impacts memory consumption)
